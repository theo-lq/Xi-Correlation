# Xi correlation coefficient

Implementation of the Xi correlation coefficient described by Sourav Chatterjee in https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10140. There exists other implementation, but none of them suits me well. I prefered to rebuild it, and decided to use functionnal programming to look like the *pearsonr* or *spearmanr* function from scipy.stats.
